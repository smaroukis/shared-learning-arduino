There are a lot of tutorials about setting up there so this page will be just a #stub - with issues that you may come across.

Tips
- always need "board" on "port" - the Arduino IDE makes this easy with one click - or you can set individually

If you want a more powerful IDE, you can use the popular [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) extension to do Arduino (and many other MCU) builds. If you want to go fully browser based you can try [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).
