> I'm using Obsidian so many of these are Obsidian specific. 

1. (optional) Read the [[Project Introduction]] to understand the purpose of this specific shared Vault. 
2. Read [[Meta - Guidlines for Using Shared Vaults]] to understand the layout, benefits, and drawbacks of using a shared Vault. 
3. Make a Personal Folder and Your Personal Page ( see  [_Name](_Name.md) for a template_) or `./Personal Folders` for already existing ones.
4. Edit you Markdown-Client Settings:
	- use markdown link syntax (instead of wikilinks)
	- use full link paths relative to the root
5. Add your name to the [Contributors](_Start%20Here.md#Contributors) list.

## General Editing Guidelines
- Keep Personal & Project Folders in `Personal Folders/<user>`. 
- Root level pages should be relevant to the knowledge topic being explored - i.e. use a **flat file structure**. 
	- instead of `Electrical Engineering/Microprocessors/Atmetl-AVR.md` just place `Atmel-AVR.md` in the root folder. If you want to include a hierarchy you can put `parent: Microprocessors` in the file text.
- When editing the root level pages/files add your "nametag" (e.g. `#tmi` for `that_marouk_ish`) to an H2 Level "Contributors" heading.  (see below)
- Make sure you have rights to use pictures etc. that you include in your notes since this is hosted publicly.
