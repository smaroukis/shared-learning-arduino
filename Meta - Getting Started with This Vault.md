## Start Here
> I'm using the Obsidian notetaking app so many of these are Obsidian specific. 

1. Read the [README](README.md) to understand the purpose of this specific shared Vault. 
2. Read [Meta - Guidelines for Using Shared Vaults](Meta%20-%20Guidelines%20for%20Using%20Shared%20Vaults.md) to understand the layout, benefits, and drawbacks of using a shared Vault. 
3. Make a Personal Folder and Your Personal Page ( see  [_Name](_Name.md) for a template_) or `./Personal Folders` for already existing ones.
4. Edit you Markdown-Client Settings:
	- use markdown link syntax (instead of wikilinks)
	- use full link paths relative to the root
5. (optional) start a log of what you're working on in `<your_username>/<username> Log.md` - example under `./Personal Folders/that_marouk_ish/tmi Log.md`
6. (optional) post the log to https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/xsn3uh/shared_beginner_arduino_log_first_15_days/

## General Editing Guidelines
#refactor this with [Meta - Guidelines for Using Shared Vaults](Meta%20-%20Guidelines%20for%20Using%20Shared%20Vaults.md)

- Keep Personal & Project Folders in `Personal Folders/<user>`. 
- Root level pages should be relevant to the knowledge topic being explored - i.e. use a **flat file structure**. 
	- instead of `Electrical Engineering/Microprocessors/Atmetl-AVR.md` just place `Atmel-AVR.md` in the root folder. If you want to include a hierarchy you can put `parent: Microprocessors` in the file text.
- Make sure you have rights to use pictures etc. that you include in your notes since this is hosted publicly.
