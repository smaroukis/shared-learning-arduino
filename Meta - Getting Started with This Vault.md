## Start Here
> I'm using the Obsidian notetaking app so many of these are Obsidian specific. 

1. Read the [[README]] to understand the purpose of this specific shared Vault. 
2. Read [[Meta - Guidelines for Using Shared Vaults]] to understand the layout, benefits, and drawbacks of using a shared Vault. 
3. Make a Personal Folder and Your Personal Page ( see  [[Personal Folders/_Personal-Template-Folder/_Name]] for a template_) or `./Personal Folders` for already existing ones.
4. Edit you Markdown-Client Settings:
	- use markdown link syntax (instead of wikilinks) - this way it shows up on github without an inbetween processor
	- use full link paths relative to the root
5. (optional) start a log of what you're working on in `<your_username>/<username> Log.md` - example under `./Personal Folders/that_marouk_ish/tmi Log.md`
