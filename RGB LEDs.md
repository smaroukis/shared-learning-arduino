> Note that we must use individual resistors for each LED color due to 1) the differences in forward voltage for each color and 2) variable current through each LED based on how bright or dim they are see  https://www.circuitbread.com/tutorials/how-rgb-leds-work-and-how-to-control-color and https://www.circuitbread.com/tutorials/why-cant-i-share-a-resistor-on-the-common-anode-or-cathode-of-my-rgb-led
