Communication - [[Serial Communication]]
- as in the Uno, 0 and 1 pins are used for communicating with the computer - avoid connecting peripherals 
- Mega has more Serial ports than the [[Uno]] (see [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/) - an additional 3 TX/RX pin pairs)
	- To use these extra serial ports to communicate with your personal computer, you will need an additional USB-to-serial adaptor, as they are not connected to the Megaâ€™s USB-to-serial adaptor.
	- watch out for voltage levels of RS232 serial ports (12V)

**TImers**
- six timers, each is interrelated with 2 or 3 pins
- using some functions that use the Timers can interfere with the ouput on the related pins (see [here - Timer](https://ht-deko.com/arduino/mega2560.html#02))
