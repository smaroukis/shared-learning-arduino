> [!INFO] What makes the Mega special is its large number of pins, including 4 dedicated UART hardware controllers for communication, as well as more PWM-capable pins than the Uno.

### Pins
- General Purpose Digital Pins with PWM
	- `2` to `13`
- General Purpose Digital
	- `22` to `53`
- UART (hardware serial ports) - 4 pairs of Rx/Tx ➡️ see [[Serial Communication]]
	- `0` and `1` are used for `RXO` and `TXO` respectively - also used by the Serial Monitor
	-`14` to `19` are `TX/RX` pairs
	- `20`, `21` are `SDA` and `SCL` respectively 
-  Power Pins
	- VIN= 6-20V to the board (7-12V recommended, same as the [[Uno]])
- Limits
	- 20mA on I/O pins
	- 50mA on 3.3V pins
	
Communication 
- as in the Uno, 0 and 1 pins are used for communicating with the computer - avoid connecting peripherals when using the serial monitor
- Mega has more Serial ports than the Uno -  [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/|[Uno]] - an additional 3 TX/RX pin pairs)
	- To use these extra serial ports to communicate with your personal computer, you will need an additional USB-to-serial adaptor, as they are not connected to the Mega’s USB-to-serial adaptor.
	- watch out for voltage levels of RS232 serial ports (12V)

**TImers**
- six timers, each is interrelated with 2 or 3 pins
- using some functions that use the Timers can interfere with the output on the related pins (see [[https://ht-deko.com/arduino/mega2560.html#02]])
