We should focus on portability between different editors (e.g. github, other markdown applications).

Markdown itself is inherently portable. But the standard is actually not well defined, with many applications and websites using their own "flavor". 

**Main Guidelines**
- don't use YAML front matter 
- limit use of plugins (see [[Meta - Useful Obsidian Plugins]])
- keep Personal & Project Notes in a Personal Folder

**Obsidian Specific Guidelines**
- 

**TDF Guidelines**
- [[wikilinks vs. markdown links]]

**Breaking/Issues**
- sometimes I use embedded-page references in a folded callout, esp. to reference a table, which won't show up for other editors
