> [!NOTE] A note about this page and the hierarchy.
> This page should be the jumping off page for learning the fundamental Arduino software concepts. For more advanced concepts see [Other Software and Computer Concepts](Other%20Software%20and%20Computer%20Concepts.md) (e.g. specific C-functions, intermediate + usages, etc.)

1. [Arduino Variable Types](Arduino%20Variable%20Types.md), [Arduino Case Statements](Arduino%20Case%20Statements.md), [Arduino Boolean and Arithmetic](Arduino%20Boolean%20and%20Arithmetic.md), [Arduino Functions](Arduino%20Functions.md)
2. [Multitasking and non blocking delays](Multitasking%20and%20non%20blocking%20delays.md)
	After learning about the basics of the software, an important part of programming for microcontrollers is about not blocking the software from doing other things.

[Avoid magic numbers](Avoid%20magic%20numbers)
- instead of `if (val !== 42)` define a constant variable to hold `42` and compare against that instead
