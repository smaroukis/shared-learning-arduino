This is my personal folder where I put all of my example projects I go through as I learn Arduino. 

The projects are described in the markdown files in this folder such as [tmi02 Digital Inputs](tmi02%20Digital%20Inputs.md) (until I upload a Blink sketch). All of the `tmi0X<project_name>.md` files have a summary of the project, the physical setup, and an inline copy of the code for quick perusal. There are also resources and further exploration prompts at the bottom.

The actual code sketches for each project are under `./code/`.
