This is my personal folder where I put all of my example projects I go through as I learn Arduino. 

The projects are described in the markdown files in this folder such as [[tmi02 Digital Inputs]] (until I upload a Blink sketch). All of the `tmi0X<project_name>.md` files have a summary of the project, the physical setup, and an inline copy of the code for quick perusal. There are also resources and further exploration prompts at the bottom.

The actual code sketches for each project are under `./code/`.

List of projects so far:
- [[tmi02 Digital Inputs]]
- [[tmi03 Digital Inputs Debounce w Millis]]
- [[tmi04 RGB LED]]
- [[tmi05 Pushbutton LED Fade]]
- [[tmi06 LDR analogWrite to LED]]
- [[tmi07 Buzzers]]
- [[tmi08 Micro Servo]]
- [[tmi09 Ultrasonic Sensor]]
- [[tmi10 Matrix Keypad]]
- [[tmi11 Temp and Humidity Sensor]]
- [[tmi12 Serial Input Basics]]
