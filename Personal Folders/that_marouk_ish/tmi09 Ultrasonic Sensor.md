Desired Goal:
- 

Concepts:

Ultrasonic Sensor
- using the `HC-SR04` library
- a trigger pulse (HIGH) is sent to the module 
	- on the `TRIG` pin
- the module sends a pulse out and detects whether it gets a pulse back
- the module responds with a echo pulse to the user (arduino) circuit
	- on the `ECHO` pin
	- the pulse duration is in proportion to the distance away
- timing diagram is important

Physical Setup:


Code:


``` c

```

Improvements:
-
