Went through https://forum.arduino.cc/t/serial-input-basics-updated/382007/2 to understand Serial comms, non-blocking
- learned how *not* to use blocking functions like `Serial.parseInt()`, and instead using a `while(Serial.available() > 0 && newData == false)` check  to process and store _new data_ and a `if (newData == true)` check to _write_ the store data to the output

Did some diagramming about the things I still want to learn and some projects that are related. Perused the code on the [Arduino Built In Examples](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/) to make sure I had seen most of the beginner stuff, which I had (well except for pots - but I already knew how voltage dividers work)

Something that was new was the Calibrate Sensor Input and the Smoothing Readings From an Analog Input, which are some useful techniques.

I didn't really do too much of the String and USB examples since I think I'm generally more interested in sensors and whatnot.

Day 6 & 7 Ultrasonic Sensor, Matrix Keypad, Now What? 

`<commentary>`
I'm getting a little tired of just reading sensor data to the Serial Monitor, but now I think I have enough knowledge to try to interface a few different sensors into a novel larger project. I think the next day will be spent browsing interesting projects and creating some ideas. Things I still haven't covered and would like to incorporate before the end of day 15:
- Serial Communications other than with the Serial Monitor e.g. I2C, etc
- LCD screens
- real time clock
- shift register
- [x] strings and chars to the Serial Monitor
- stepper motors
- IR

**Ultrasonic Sensor (SR04)** ([github](https://github.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino/blob/main/Personal%20Folders/that_marouk_ish/tmi09%20Ultrasonic%20Sensor.md))

Goal: Write the real time distance measured by the sensor to the Serial Monitor

It is more fun to write it without the library, although it is nice that you can be up and running with just a library and some examples.

The sensor waits for a trigger pulse, then sends out a pulse and listens for the return, the data is returned via the ECHO pin, with a duration of a pulse equal to the time between sending and receiving. 

Use the built in  `pulseIn()` function to store the pulse (returns microseconds). e.g. 

```c
duration = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH); // returns microseconds

// distance = 1/2 * (duration * k_speed-of-sound-in-air)
// k = 343 m/s (at T=20C) = 0.0343 cm/us
cm = (duration/2) * 0.0343; 
```

**Matrix Keypad** ([github](https://github.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino/blob/main/Personal%20Folders/that_marouk_ish/tmi10%20Matrix%20Keypad.md))

Goal: Output the current button press to the Serial Monitor (no libraries)

Worked with arrays and nested loops. We loop through columns setting them as OUTPUTs, writing them LOW, then we loop through the rows setting them HIGH with an INPUT_PULLUP. If a button is pressed it completes the circuit pulling the input LOW. 

Interestingly I had setup my array incorrectly and the rows and columns were reversed - since the Keypad pins are defined right to left and bottom to top, but we loop/access the array from the opposite direction, one of them has to be reversed in the code. [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino/main/Personal%20Folders/that_marouk_ish/attachments/IMG_7355.jpg).

**Day 5 - Active vs Passive Buzzers, Servos (+Questions)**

**Mini Project 07 - Buzzers**  ([github](https://github.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino/blob/main/Personal%20Folders/that_marouk_ish/tmi08%20Micro%20Servo.md))
- various types of buzzers, by operating principle (magnetic or piezo) and input (DC / AC)
- to change tone use _frequency modulation_ (not PWM which changes effective DC *amplitude*) 
- active buzzers have their own oscillating circuit, but for passive buzzers you must supply an oscillating square wave (the `tone()` function handles this for Arduino on any pin). 
- I used a pullup input plus a pushbutton to beep when pressed 

It is just a simple digital output - but notably my buzzer didn't require a limiting resistor unlike a speaker or LED.

``` c
void setup(){
  pinMode(BUZZER, OUTPUT); // digital output (DC HIGH/LOW) since it is an active buzzer
  pinMode(BUTTON, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop(){
  buttonState = !digitalRead(BUTTON); // due to pullup (unpressed = 5V), logic is reversed

  // if button is pressed, set the buzzer HIGH (DC)
  if (buttonState == 1){
    digitalWrite(BUZZER, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(BUZZER, LOW);
  }
}
```

Using the `tone()` function with a passive buzzer:
``` c
for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < 8; thisNote++) {
	tone(BUZZER_PASSIVE, melody[thisNote], 500); // where melody is an array of ints containing the notes, see the built in example
	delay(1000);
}
noTone(BUZZER_PASSIVE); // to stop it
```

**Mini Project 08 - Servo** ([github](https://github.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino/blob/main/Personal%20Folders/that_marouk_ish/tmi07%20Buzzers.md))
- one or two servos can be powered directly from 5V on the Arduino (at least for my mini servos - check the current draw is under 20mA as usual)
- to drive the servo we provide a pulse to a signal pin - the duration of the pulse is proportional to the rotation
- the `Servo` library handles this for us, we just need to provide an angle in degrees (download from Library Manager) 

e.g. 
``` c
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo; // create Servo object from the library

void setup(){
	myservo.attach(SERVO_PIN); // digital pin
	myservo.write(90); // moves servo to center position -> 90Â°
}
```

Outstanding Questions
- why doesn't the buzzer need a current limiting resistor like a LED or speaker? Mine is 16 Ohms

[2022-10-06](2022-10-06)
Day 4 - LDR and `millis()` Debouncing, Using the Serial Monitor

Code Snippets
``` c
analogWrite(LED, val/4); // since analogRead() is 16 bit but analogWrite is 8 bit ()
```

``` c
led_state = (led_state == LOW ? HIGH : LOW); // ternary operator to switch led state
```

Hardware Learnings
- Using digital inputs as pullups allows you to forego the current limiting resistor if they were "ON" at 5V. (e.g. `pinMode(7, INPUT_PULLUP)`
- LDRs - use 10K load/sense resistor in the example -my LDR varies from 20kOhms (10 lux) to 2MOhms (0 lux) - the voltage sensed by the pin is over the sense resistor

Day 3 - Fading LED, Pushbutton Orientation

Today I spent a lot of time debugging both some code errors and wiring errors. I kept forgetting the orientation of the pushbutton contacts - even looking at the schematics of the internals. But then I realized the orientation in the photo is the same as a breadboard if it spans the rails, so you don't need to look at the back to determine which contacts are connected...whew. 

The mini-project combined some code from the Built in [Fade Example](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Fade) and from the _Make:_ book Getting Started with Arduino (Banzi, Shiloh). 

I specifically liked the `fadeAmount = -fadeAmount` line to switch between fading in and out. (see line 47 of [the code](https://github.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino/blob/main/Personal%20Folders/that_marouk_ish/code/tmi05_pushbutton_led_fade/tmi05_pushbutton_led_fade.ino) in the hosted version)

Mostly I felt good about self-identifying and fixing the wiring and coding errors, even though it took me longer than I thought. I like to type everything out by hand to get a feel for the syntax but it's easy to make software mistakes and then think it is a wiring issues and vice versa.

Day 2 - Party Time - RGB LEDs 
So today I was onto the first interesting project that I learned more than I expected from. Mostly on the analog side about LEDs and their I-V curves.  

The project was to fade/cycle through various colors using an RGB LED controlled with PWM from the Arduino.  

The RGB LED is three separate LEDs with a common node, and we can make "any" light color by varying the intensities of each channel - the LEDs are close enough in space that we see the combination as a singular color. The intensity of each channel is varied by PWM.  

I learned why I have a ton more of 220Ohm resistors in my kit than the others:  
Limiting the load on a pin to 20mA: assuming worst case (lowest forward voltage) of 1.8V across an LED when on, with a 5V input leaves 3.2V across a resistor. The 220Ohm resistor limits this to I=3.3V/220=15mA.  â¡ï¸ [Resistor Calculation for LEDs](../../Resistor%20Calculation%20for%20LEDs.md)

But then I thought I could just use one resistor on the cathode instead of three separate resistors on the anodes. I quickly learned that due to the difference in forward voltage for the different colors, this wouldn't work. Basically, the red LED will turn on before the others. Also, the total current will change based on how intense each channel shines, so the light will change intensity based on the color, which we don't want

I changed the tutorial's `#define`s to `const int` - another thing I learned (define's are from the C language but const int is generally better for beginners)

RGB LEDs Going further #tdf-project
-   Use finer tuned resistors for each color to get intensities to match
-   Avoid light intensity changing based on the color
-   Add more colors
-   Set the color by a potentiometer
- Better code (see [example](https://os.mbed.com/users/4180_1/notebook/rgb-leds/#:~:text=The%20three%20LEDs%20inside%20a,may%20drop%20around%203%20volts.))


[2022-10-03](2022-10-03)
Nothing today except some reading about `millis()` vs `delay()` - basically just get comfortable with `millis()` since it allows you to do multiple things at (perceivable) the same time (see Notepad)

[2022-10-02](2022-10-02) - Day 1 - Unboxing  - a Mega?? and Blink

I thought I had ordered an (unofficial) Uno starter kit but when I opened it I found a Mega inside. Honestly I wanted an Uno, since I'm sure many tutorials are built off that, and if I want to use an Uno later I'll have to check and change the pin numbers in the code. 

 So I learned besides the main differences (more pins, more PWM, more storage, ATMega2560 vs ATMega328P), another one is that the Mega has a USB to Serial driver chip built in, where-as the Uno's ATMEGA328P needs an external ATMega 16U2 USB-to-Serial converter. 

Well, then, after that rabbit hole I did follow the instructions to get it to blink the led, and changed it from 1s to 0.5s. Also changed the variable `LED_BUILTIN` to `13` to verify that is the correct LED pin for the Mega. 


[[2022-10-01]]
Started this Vault with [Arduino](Arduino.md). Learned that [Arduino - PWM](Arduino%20-%20PWM.md) outputs a square wave, specific values (steps) are determined by the ADC converter - [Uno](Uno.md) is 10 bit (so $2^{10}=1024$ steps). More advanced Arduinos have ADCs with higher resolution, but must use the `analogReadResolution()` function to set this. 

Also learned that `analogRead()` and `analogWrite()` functions have different bounds ( 0 to 1023 and 0 to 255 respectively).
