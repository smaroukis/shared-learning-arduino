## About Me
My background is in electric power systems, as a Distribution Engineer for a few large electric utility companies, mostly in real time grid operations. I'm learning more about electronics to get a different perspective on how we interact with electrical devices. I created this shared learning vault to hold myself and others publicly accountable for getting through the beginning learning steps of Arduino, as well as connect with others beginning their foray into electronics.
