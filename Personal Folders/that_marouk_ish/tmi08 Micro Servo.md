Desired Goal:
- Uses the `servo` library to drive a small servo motor.

Concepts:
- 

Physical Setup:

> Using a small SG90 servo motor from the Elegoo kit. It is light weight so it doesn't need a transistor to drive it, and it can be connected directly to 5V. 

- The motor (+) lead is connected directly to 5V on the Arduino and (-) to ground. The motor is driven by an Arduino PWM output pin to the `pulse` pin on the motor.
