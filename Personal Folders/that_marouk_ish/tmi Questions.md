- what is the difference between a compiler and an interepreter? #q
	- first pass: a **compiler** takes the human-readable code (e.g. C++ or C or Arduino C) and compiless it to assembly and machine code. An example is the gcc compiler. an **interpreter** is a layer of abstraction above the compiler, it is what the Arduino does behind the scenes to convert the Arduino C to the C that can be compiled by gcc. 
	- further questions: can you see the output of the interpreter?
