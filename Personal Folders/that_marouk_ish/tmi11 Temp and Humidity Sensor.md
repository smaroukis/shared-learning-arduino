Desired Goal:
- 

Concepts:
- using the DH11 temperature and humidity sensor ([[code/tmi11/datasheet Lesson 12 DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.pdf|datasheet ]]) with [this DHT library](https://github.com/olewolf/DHT_nonblocking)
	- interestingly the sensor does not communicate over a Serial channel but rather uses a pulse of defined width for 0's and 1's 

Physical Setup:


Code:


``` c

```

Improvements:
-
