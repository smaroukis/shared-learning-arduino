- "When you upload a sketch, you're using the ArduinoÂ **bootloader**, a small program that has been loaded on to the microcontroller on your board. It allows you to upload code without using any additional hardware." 
- "Please note that the Serial Monitor does not process control characters; if your sketch needs a complete management of the serial communication with control characters, you can use an external terminal program and connect it to the COM port assigned to your Arduino board."

- install zip libraries directly (no need to unpackage)
- a serial terminal is important to see the interaction with the Arduino via a computer - this is the Serial Monitor
- "Selecting which port to open in the Serial Monitor is the same as selecting a port for uploading Arduino code. Go to Tools -> Serial Port, and select the correct port." (source: [elegooCompleteStarterMega2560](elegooCompleteStarterMega2560.md)) - should be the same COM port as in DeviceManager
- [Mega2560](Mega2560.md) led is digital pin 13, see `LED_BUILTIN` variable
- tools > set board
- tools > set port (forgot this one)
- changed it to 500ms
