Desired Goal: 
- when you press the button it turns the LED on and off (without holding)
- when you push and hold the pushbutton the LED fades in and out repeatedly

Concepts:
- [Arduino - PWM](Arduino%20-%20PWM.md)
- [Resistors](Resistors.md) as current limiters
- [Switches](Switches.md) - Pushbuttons

Code:
- [tmi_05_pushbutton_led_fade](Personal%20Folders/that_marouk_ish%20(Spencer)/code/tmi_05_pushbutton_led_fade/tmi_05_pushbutton_led_fade.ino).
