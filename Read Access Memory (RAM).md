parent::[[Memory]]

SRAM, static RAM
- usually on-chip
- faster, uses transistors and latches (e.g. flip flops) -> requires power
- this is what is used in microctontrollers
- cycle time is shorter than DRAM


DRAM, dynamic RAM
- usually off chip
- slower, uses capacitors to store the data -> doesn't need continuous power
- short data lifetime
