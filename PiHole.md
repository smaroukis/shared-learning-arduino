> The Pi-hole[®](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/) is a [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Sinkhole) that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software

>  Pi-hole blocks adverts _before they are downloaded_ from the advertiser network/website, improving your network performance, reducing bandwidth usage and crucially speeding up page load times. Pi-hole also helps to block advertisements in other places such as mobile apps and smart TVs, where traditional ad-blocking apps aren't available/effective.


**Pi-hole as All-Around DNS Solution**
- can be used to increase privacy so DNS servers can't see  "where you came from"
- https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/

> as you're directly contacting the responsive servers, no server can fully log the exact paths you're going, as e.g. the Google DNS servers will only be asked if you want to visit a Google website, but not if you visit the website of your favorite newspaper, etc.
