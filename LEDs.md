LEDs have the same non-linear current vs voltage characteristics as diodes, but the forward or "turn on" voltage is higher.

If we use the simple diode-as-a-voltage-controlled switch model (an open circuit until $V_F$ is appleid across the terminals, and then it is a short), the typical turn on or forward voltages for each color LED is as follows:

| Color | On Voltage | Common Semiconductor Material               |     |     |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| RED   | 1.8-2.2    | Aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)          |     |     |
| Green | 2.0-3.5    | Aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) |     |     |
| Blue  | 3.0-3.5    | Gallium nitride (GaN)                       |     |     |
| White | 3.0-3.5    |                                             |     |     |

This comes from the bandgap energy of the semiconductor material. The bandgap energy of the semiconductor material determines the wavelenght of light emitted. Smaller bandgap materials release photons of shorter wavelengths (â†’since the energy of a photon decreases with longer wavelengths $E = hc/\lambda = hf$)
