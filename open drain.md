#tdf

Open drain (or open collector on a BJT) means that the drain which is used as the **output**, is not connected to a source of power. This transistor configuration can force its value low (with a base input from the microcontroller) but cannot provide power. Usually a [[pull-up resistor]] is added so the device is normally high. 

Power must be provided from elsewhere.
