Open drain (or open collector on a BJT) means that the drain which is used as the **output**, is not connected to a source of power. This transistor configuration can force its value low (with a base input from the microcontroller) but cannot provide power. Usually a [pull-up resistor](pull-up%20resistor) is added so the device is normally high. 

Power must be provided from elsewhere.
