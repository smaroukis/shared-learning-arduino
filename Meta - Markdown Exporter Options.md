### Option - Using [Obsidian-Export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) (leaving vault as is, exporting staticly)

Issues
- Github kramdown syntax compatibility doesn't support `%20`?  see https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export/issues/73
- inline footnotes are not actually officially supported by commonmark, so therefore will not render correctly - https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export/issues/32

### Option - Use Converter https://github.com/ozntel/obsidian-link-converter

Issues
- can break external links https://github.com/ozntel/obsidian-link-converter/issues/12
- doesn't work with parenthesis in links https://github.com/ozntel/obsidian-link-converter/issues/8
