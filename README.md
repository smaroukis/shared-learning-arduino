## Project Description

This is a shared knowledge project to promote learning about Arduino for beginners, by beginners. It is a collection of interlinked markdown files. At the root level are Topics, you can contribute any learnings to any of these. You can create a Personal folder and page to track and log your progress.

This repo, sometimes called a "vault", is best browsed in a local markdown client like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and in fact some features are native to Obsidian, like callouts and embeds, although effort has been made to promote cross-compatibility. If there is a cross-compatibility with your markdown client of choice, feel free to submit an issue to let me know.

See [_Start Here](_Start%20Here.md) to get started.
