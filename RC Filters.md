### Time Constants
- **time constant:** you can measure the time constant in two ways; 1) the time of the decay or 2) measuring the frequency at which the output amplitude drops by a specific amount
    - step response: $V_C = V_0 e^{-t/RC}$
        - 1/2 time at $t_{1/2}=ln(2) \cdot RC \Rightarrow RC=\frac{t_{1/2}}{ln(2)}$
    - sine wave response: $V_{out}/V_{in}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(2\pi f RC)^2}}$
