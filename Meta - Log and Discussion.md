#### [2022-10-02](2022-10-02)
- #tmi 16:03 first push to Github - check it out at github.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino ! noticed a few problems: 1) even the markdown style links that Obsidian generates are not full paths - they don't include the folder - especially a problem with user pages #issue-outstanding ➡️  [wikilinks vs. markdown links](wikilinks%20vs.%20markdown%20links.md)
	- noticed even more -- since I tend to create a lot of empty  files with  the `[[`  command, there is nothing going back and changing them to markdown links
