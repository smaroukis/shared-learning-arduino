- #tmi can use Obs to link to code in github directly - need to enable all file extensions in settings - for example see [[) forum examples](Personal Folders/that_marouk_ish (Spencer|tmi 02 millis() forum examples]]/code/tmi%2002%20millis()%20forum%20examples/tmi%2002%20millis()%20forum%20examples.md)
- also changed my default image and attachment link to be under a personal assets folder

- #tmi 16:03 first push to Github - check it out at github.com/smaroukis/shared-learning-arduino ! noticed a few problems: 1) even the markdown style links that Obsidian generates are not full paths - they don't include the folder - especially a problem with user pages #issue-outstanding ➡️  [[wikilinks vs. markdown links]]
	- noticed even more -- since I tend to create a lot of empty  files with  the `[[`  command, there is nothing going back and changing them to markdown links
