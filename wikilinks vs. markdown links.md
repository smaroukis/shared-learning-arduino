**Wikilinks:**
- syntax: `[[link to page]]`
- supported by many other editors
- not native to some editors
- can be exported to markdown links

**Markdown links:**
- syntax: `[link text](full url of page)`
- useful if the vault is a repo on github - no further formatting is required for links to work


**Other Considerations**
