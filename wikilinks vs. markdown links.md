**Wikilinks:**
- e.g. `[[link to page]]`
- supported by many other editors
- not native to some editors
- can be exported to markdown links

**Markdown links:**
- e.g. `[link text](full url of page)`


**Other Considerations**

> Note: For either link type only "relative" links are created (it does not insert the full path for files in folders) - how does this affect other programs?
