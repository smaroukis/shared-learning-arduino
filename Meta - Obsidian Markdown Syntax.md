**Folded Callouts**

Callouts are defined like block quotes but with the following syntax:
```
> [!tip] Title
> Description
```

What's very useful about callouts is that they can be folded by default, using the `-` sign:
```
> [!tip]- A Folded Codeblock Title
> Content on this line will not be shown until unfolded
```

Example
> [!Tip]- Callouts can be styled by the keyword in the brackets
> - See the [Obsidian Docs](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts#Types) for a list of callout types
> - The keyword is case independent
> - You can nest markdown formatting inside a callout
