RS-232 (ANSI/EIA-232 Standard) is the serial connection historically found on IBM-compatible PCs. It is used for many purposes, such as connecting a mouse, printer, or modem, as well as industrial instrumentation. Because of improvements in line drivers and cables, applications often increase the performance of RS-232 beyond the distance and speed listed in the standard. RS-232 is limited to point-to-point connections between PC serial ports and devices. RS-232 hardware can be used for serial communication up to distances of 50 feet.

> [!CAUTION] A MCU cannot generate the voltage levels needed for RS-232 so a RS-232 line driver is needed (e.g. the [MAX220](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX220-MAX249.pdf))
